Project Description:
Use machine learning for predicting statistics or properties of polynomials. The main goal is to find appropriate encodings of polynomials 
and answer questions such as the number of real roots, the distance of the closest real roots, the existence of double roots etc.

You have to try and compare different architectures and design an interface that will be easy to use for the predictions you cover.
